    <p>Prince Fortress was the grandson of Ragnar Lothbrok and the prince of the fortresses of Northumbria. He became the heir to the throne left by his grandfather Ragnar Lothbrok because his father died in battle with the English at a very young age. Prince Fortress looks so handsome just like his grandfather</p>
